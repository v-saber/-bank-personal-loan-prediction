# bank-personal-loan-prediction
This jupyter notebook is about a bank dataset with the customers information.
The target column is about whether the customers got any loan from the bank or not.
Our goal is to predict that if we have a customer outside this datasat and we have his/her information,
will he/she get a loan or not?<br/>
The methods used in this program are Logistic Regression, Complemented Naive Bayes and K Nearest Neighbors.
